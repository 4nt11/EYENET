# TODO

Deferred work, captured so it isn't lost. Not in priority order.

## POST /v1/identities — session-file upload (provision an identity from the UI)

**Vision:** configure a new Telegram (or Matrix) identity by uploading its
`.session` file and metadata, instead of the current `identities.toml` +
`eyenet identity sync` CLI/config flow.

**Shape:** `POST /v1/identities` multipart — the `.session` blob + `{name,
source_id, role, cooldown_seconds?, proxy_uri?}`. Handler encrypts the blob at
rest (writes `session_path`), then `create_identity(...)`. Returns
`IdentityDetail` (the read schema from the identities-read PR).

**Why it's deferred / build with eyes open:** the `.session` file is effectively
a full account-takeover credential. The current design deliberately keeps it
OFF the network surface (operator handles the file locally; `session_path`/
`proxy_uri` are also omitted from the read API). An upload route is a real
attack-surface expansion. Requirements when we build it:
- `write:identity` + admin gate; audit every upload (who, when, which source).
- Encrypt at rest; never echo the blob back; `session_path` stays off reads.
- Validate the uploaded blob is a real session before persisting.
- Consider size limits + the interactive Telethon auth story (the operator
  still has to obtain a valid `.session` out-of-band first).

Pairs with the read surface (`GET /v1/identities` + `/{id}`) already shipped,
and fully unblocks a "provision identity from the UI" flow.

## Audit-anchor external sinks (§5.9) — dispatch to external witnesses

**Shipped:** the anchor subsystem records signed `(audit_head, journal_head)`
heartbeats (`AnchorEmitter` + `eyenet anchor`), stores them, publishes each on
`eyenet.audit.anchor`, and serves them via `GET /v1/audit/anchors`.

**Deferred:** the operator-configured *external sinks* that actually deliver
anchors to third parties — file drop, webhook POST, email. §5.9's whole point is
that an outside party holds a copy, so a rolled-back or forked chain is
detectable. The bus subject is the machine-readable feed a sink consumes; the
sink deliverer itself is a separate config + delivery subsystem.

**Shape when we build it:** a small dispatcher subscribing `eyenet.audit.anchor`
(or reading the table) with per-sink config (`[audit.anchor.sinks.*]` TOML:
kind=file|webhook|email, destination, retry/backoff). Delivery is best-effort +
durable-retry; a sink failure must never block the emitter. Consider a
delivery-receipt log so the operator can prove an anchor reached witness X.

## Clearance bootstrap — admin must self-grant `admin:clearance`

**Not a bug, a §4.8 design consequence worth surfacing:** `admin:clearance` is a
grant-only scope, in NO role baseline. So the clearance page (and the 4 grant
handlers) return **403** until an operator explicitly grants themselves the
scope via `eyenet user scopes`. First-run UX gap: a fresh admin sees "forbidden"
with no in-product hint.

**Options when we polish:** document the `eyenet user scopes ... admin:clearance`
bootstrap step in the operator guide; and/or have the FE render a clear "you need
an admin:clearance grant" affordance on 403 instead of a generic error.
