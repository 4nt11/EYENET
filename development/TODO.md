Deferred work, captured so it isn't lost. Not in priority order.

## POST /v1/identities — session-file upload (provision an identity from the UI)

**Vision:** configure a new Telegram (or Matrix) identity by uploading its
`.session` file and metadata, instead of the current `identities.toml` +
`eyenet identity sync` CLI/config flow.

**Shape:** `POST /v1/identities` multipart — the `.session` blob + `{name,
source_id, role, cooldown_seconds?, proxy_uri?}`. Handler encrypts the blob at
rest (writes `session_path`), then `create_identity(...)`. Returns
`IdentityDetail` (the read schema from the identities-read PR).

**Why it's deferred / build with eyes open:** the `.session` file is effectively
a full account-takeover credential. The current design deliberately keeps it
OFF the network surface (operator handles the file locally; `session_path`/
`proxy_uri` are also omitted from the read API). An upload route is a real
attack-surface expansion. Requirements when we build it:
- `write:identity` + admin gate; audit every upload (who, when, which source).
- Encrypt at rest; never echo the blob back; `session_path` stays off reads.
- Validate the uploaded blob is a real session before persisting.
- Consider size limits + the interactive Telethon auth story (the operator
  still has to obtain a valid `.session` out-of-band first).

Pairs with the read surface (`GET /v1/identities` + `/{id}`) already shipped,
and fully unblocks a "provision identity from the UI" flow.
